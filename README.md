# Richard Glosser's Portfolio Page
A personal Portfolio/Resume Website exploring my Computer Science Experience and project involvment.

# About Me
The home page is all about me! So I i placed importance on my title, my career related social media and portfolios, and my interests outside of Computer Science.

# Resume Page
Focused on a resume page and radiated outward on what highlighted my experience best. Mentioning soft skills on the resume page to display content I could not have in resume.

#Projects
Dedicated a page to the projects I have contributed to or created, with the potential to expand on it in the future. Heavy importance on linking to the actual project websites.
